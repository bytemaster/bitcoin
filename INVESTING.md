----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BitShares are a new crypto-currency that will enable a distributed peer-to-peer
bank and exchange without counter-party-risk.  This bank will allow individuals
to make interest-bearing deposits in anonymous accounts denominated in any currency 
and transfer those balances to anyone in the world anonymously and securely.  If this 
system works as I belive it will, then it would completely replace Bitcoin, Ripple, and Mt.Gox, and all 
comodities exchanges.  It would enable interest-bearing gold and silver accounts
without counterparty risk.  In effect, this system could be more valuable than
Bitcoin, Mt.Gox, and Ripple combined.

To help bootstrap this system will require time and money of many people to
write software, create tutorials, and help explain it to the masses.  Therefore,
I am creating an opportunity to buy pre-release BitShares today in the most fair
way I can conceive.

Investment Address
------------------
Anyone who sends Bitcoins to 18dzTA5JDLrP5bu6spDSqK9wGDLS4sM5bU will receive 1,000
BitShares per BitCoin in the gensis block of the new BitShare blockchain.  The gensis block will
use the same private keys from your bitcoin wallet used to send your investment to allow you 
to redeem your BitShares (simply import your bitcoin wallet).

Pre-mining investment under these terms will be limited to 1 million total BitShares, first-come, first-serve.

Pre-mined BitShares will be in addition to the 21,000,000 mined BitShares.

Opportunity to invest expires once gensis chain has been launched.

Investment Terms Modification 
-----------------
This contract may be revised/updated by updating https://github.com/bytemaster/bitshare/INVESTING.md 

Any investments made after an update is pushed to Github shall fall under the new terms. Investments
made prior to the Github update will honored under the existing terms.


Use of Funds
-----------------
All bitcoins sent to 18dzTA5JDLrP5bu6spDSqK9wGDLS4sM5bU may be used at my sole discretion to
pay for the development of BitShares and its promotion.  

Promise to Investors
--------------------
I will release a BitShares client derived from Bitcoin with the following changes:

1) Half of all mining / transaction fees will be paid to those who hold BitShares
2) BitShares may be 'mortgaged' to back the creation of any number of sub-currencies at the highest bid output included in a block.
3) 'Mortgaged' BitShares will pay their dividends to owners of the sub-currency they were mortgaged to create.
4) 'Mortgaged' BitShares may only be redeemed by their creator at the original exchange rate.
5) The hashing algorithm will require 128 MB of Ram, accessed in psuedo-random order, and ultimately conclude with a double SHA256()
6) Every transaction output will be annotated with a sub-currency unit.
7) A new output Script command will be created that allows an output to be redeemed if it is part of a transaction that
   performs an exchange at a defined rate to an output redeemable by a specified address.

Variations on these changes may be made at my discretion for the purpose of ensuring the
economic model will work as desired or for a functionally equavlent alternative design.

Timeline
--------------------
The timeline depends upon the total invested.  If the total investment can reach 700 BTC or more, 
then I will quit my day job and work on this full time.  Estimating development times is a very
difficult task, but I believe these changes will require about 1 or 2 months to develop and 
deploy to a test network and another 1 to 2 months of testing prior to releasing Version 1.0.

Invest at your Own Risk
-------------------
I make no guarantees that these changes will result in the economic behavior that I predict. I cannot
promise that BitShares will be widely adopted or that they will have any future value what-so-ever. 


Disputes
-------------------
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach of this contract, shall be settled by binding internet arbitration at judge.me in accordance with the judge.me arbitration agreement. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding and judgment may be entered thereon.

If you would like the right to dispute this contract, you must email dlarimer@gmail.com a signed (with your bitcoin address) copy of this
contract prior-to sending investment funds to 18dzTA5JDLrP5bu6spDSqK9wGDLS4sM5bU.
